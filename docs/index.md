## The Challenge

**Try to deny that distinction exists.**

To say "there is no distinction" — you must distinguish that statement from its opposite. To think "nothing is different from anything" — you must differentiate that thought from other thoughts.

**You cannot deny distinction without using distinction.**

This is not wordplay. It's an unavoidable logical fact:
- To assert requires distinguishing assertion from non-assertion
- To deny requires distinguishing denial from acceptance  
- Even silence distinguishes itself from speech

The First Distinction (D₀) cannot be coherently rejected. It is **self-evident** in the strongest possible sense: its denial presupposes it.

## The Dirac Equation IS K₄

The most fundamental equation of particle physics:

$$(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m)\psi = 0$$

**Every number in this equation comes from K₄:**

| Dirac (1928) | K₄ Structure | Value |
|--------------|--------------|-------|
| γ-matrices | Vertices | **4** |
| Bivectors (γᵘγᵛ) | Edges | **6** |
| Clifford dimension | 2^Vertices | **16** |
| Spinor components | \|Bool\|² | **4** |
| Gyromagnetic ratio g | \|Bool\| | **2** |
| Signature | Drift asymmetry | **(−,+,+,+)** |

Dirac spent 4 years deriving this relativistically. We show: **he found K₄ in the continuum limit.**

And K₄ comes from D₀ = {φ, ¬φ} = "yes or no".

**The equation that predicts antimatter follows from the simplest possible distinction.**

## The Ontology

From this single unavoidable fact, we construct K₄:

> **What exists is exactly what can be constructed.**

This is not a philosophical position we *choose*. It's the position that Agda (our proof system) *embodies*. In constructive type theory:
- "X exists" means "X can be built"
- No axioms, no assumptions, no faith required
- If you can't construct it, it doesn't exist in the proof

**One premise. Zero parameters. Machine-checked.**

## What is First Distinction?

**First Distinction (FD)** constructs K₄ (the complete graph on 4 vertices) from a single premise:

> Something is distinguishable from something.

K₄ produces numbers matching physical constants: d=3, κ=8, α⁻¹=137, particle mass ratios.

The complete proof is formalized in [Agda](https://github.com/de-johannes/FirstDistinction/blob/main/FirstDistinction.agda) and compiles under `--safe --without-K` — no postulates, no holes, machine-checked.

---

## What is Agda?

**Agda** is a functional programming language with dependent types and an interactive proof assistant. Unlike mathematical proofs on paper, every step is machine-checked — the compiler guarantees logical consistency.

**Why Agda for First Distinction?**

- **No hidden assumptions:** The `--safe --without-K` mode forbids logical axioms and postulates. What is not explicitly derived does not exist.
- **Full transparency:** Anyone can verify the proof themselves — a single compiler run suffices.
- **Reproducible:** The result does not depend on human interpretation.

**What does "proof" mean in Agda?**

A proof is a program whose type encodes a mathematical statement. If the program compiles, the statement is proven.

- *For physicists:* Like a numerical experiment that is always exactly reproducible — but with symbolic rather than numerical precision.
- *For mathematicians:* Like a formally verified proof in a Hilbert system, machine-checked for correctness.

## What is computed?

The following are **mathematical theorems** (Agda `--safe --without-K`):

| Quantity | K₄ Formula | Result | Physical Match |
|----------|------------|--------|----------------|
| Dimension | λ=4 multiplicity | **d = 3** | ✓ 3 spatial |
| Time | Drift asymmetry | **1** | ✓ 1 temporal |
| Signature | Symmetric/asymmetric | **(−,+,+,+)** | ✓ matches GR |
| Coupling | dim × χ | **κ = 8** | ✓ matches 8πG |
| Gyromagnetic | \|Bool\| | **g = 2** | ✓ Dirac prediction |
| Spectral formula | λ³χ + deg² + corr | **137.036** | ≈ α⁻¹ (0.00003%) |
| Anomaly | 1/(α⁻¹ × E) | **1/822** | ≈ (g-2)/2 (~5%) |
| Epoch count | 5 × 4¹⁰⁰ | **N** | ≈ τ/t_P (0.4%) |

**5 exact matches. 3 excellent matches. The ~5% error is systematic (E=6 vs 2π=6.28).**

**The mathematical computations are proven. That they correspond to physical reality is a hypothesis supported by remarkable numerical agreement.**

## Why Type Theory?

In 1972, Per Martin-Löf created intuitionistic type theory.

The unit type ⊤ has exactly one inhabitant. The empty type ⊥ has none. This isn't arbitrary — it's the **only** way to have "something" versus "nothing" without presupposing structure.

We observe: **⊤ with `tt` has the same structure as D₀ with φ.**

| Martin-Löf (1972) | First Distinction |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| ⊥ (empty type) | Before distinction |
| ⊤ (unit type) | D₀ — the First Distinction |
| Bool | φ vs ¬φ |
| _≡_ (identity) | Self-recognition of D₀ |

Type theory embodies constructivism. We use it to construct K₄.

## How does it work?

**In plain language:**

1. **You can't have ONE distinction alone**  
   If D₀ exists, you can distinguish D₀ from "not D₀". That's a second distinction D₁.

2. **Two distinctions need a third**  
   "D₀ is different from D₁" — that *relation* is itself a distinction: D₂.

3. **Three isn't stable**  
   Now (D₀, D₂) is a new pair without a witness. This forces D₃.

4. **Four is stable**  
   With 4 distinctions, all 6 possible pairs are "witnessed". Nothing new is forced.

5. **Four points = Tetrahedron = 3D space**  
   The geometry of 4 vertices connected by 6 edges IS three-dimensional space.

6. **The process of arriving there = Time**  
   The irreversible sequence D₀ → D₁ → D₂ → D₃ is the arrow of time.

**That's it.** From "distinction exists" to 3+1 dimensional spacetime in 6 steps.

## Check it yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/de-johannes/FirstDistinction.git
cd FirstDistinction
agda --safe --without-K --no-libraries FirstDistinction.agda
```

[![CI](https://github.com/de-johannes/FirstDistinction/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/de-johannes/FirstDistinction/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

The code is the claim. If it compiles, the proof is valid.

[→ Verification](verify)

---

## Honesty

**What IS proven (Agda `--safe`):**
- K₄ emerges from self-referential distinction
- The K₄ spectral formula produces 137.036...
- The structural formula produces N = 5 × 4¹⁰⁰
- All computations are verified by the type-checker

**What is HYPOTHESIS:**
- That these mathematical objects ARE the physical constants
- That K₄ structure IS the geometry of our universe
- That the numerical agreements are not coincidental

The mathematics is machine-verified. The physics interpretation requires experiment. We present the strongest possible mathematical evidence, but the identification with physics remains a testable claim.

If you find an error, open an issue. We want to know.

## AI Disclosure

This work was created over 12 months by one person using six different AI systems (Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet, ChatGPT, Gemini, Sonar-R1, DeepSeek-R1). Agda doesn't lie — if it compiles under `--safe --without-K`, the proof is valid.
